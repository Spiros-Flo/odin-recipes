    <h2>Description</h2>
    I love one-pan meals, especially when no measuring and exact ingredients are involved. I made this one<br>
    Sunday when I didn't want to babysit my food in the kitchen! Turned out great, and I served it with tzatziki<br>
    sauce.

    <p><small>Recipe by</small><b> Chef V</b></p>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>4 chicken leg quarters</li>
        <li>1 (24 ounce) bag small potatoes</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup olive oil</li>
        <li>2 lemons, juiced, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dried basil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon and herb seasoning</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package fresh green beans</li>        
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a<br>
            large baking sheet with sides.</li>
        <li><p>Place chicken quarters on prepared baking sheet. Stir<br>
            potatoes, olive oil, juice of 1 lemon, basil, oregano, salt,<br>
            pepper, and lemon herb seasoning together in a large bowl<br>
            to coat potatoes. Arrange potatoes around chicken on<br>
            baking sheet. Pour about 3/4 of oil mixture over chicken,<br>
            reserving remaining oil; drizzle remaining lemon juice over<br>
            chicken and potatoes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Bake in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes; shake<br>
            baking sheet to loosen potatoes, then continue baking for<br>
            15 minutes. Place green beans in reserved oil mixture; toss<br>
            to coat. Remove chicken mixture from oven; pour green<br>
            bean mixture over chicken and potatoes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Return pan to the oven; bake until green beans are tender<br>
            with a bite, chicken is no longer pink at the bone and juices<br>
            run clear, about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer<br>
            inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74<br>
            degrees C).</p></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Cook&rsquo;s Note:</h2>
    <p>If you want to brown the tops of chicken and potatoes more,<br>
        place pan under a preheated broiler for about 5 minutes, to<br>
        get a bit crispy. And don't forget the tzatziki sauce!</p>
